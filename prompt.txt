write me a PyQt5 app where i can - drag and drop excel file- a dialog window appear showing a list of column names taken from values of row 5 (but use index position instead of name string when processing the next steps). make dialog window scrollable for long list of checkboxes- i can check column that i want to retain- i can specify column width of each that i want- i can check wrap text on columns that i want- then i click proceed- the app will process the excel file to hide the not selected file- it make make alignment top aligned in a new excel file inside original directory with datestamp prefix of its original name- log errors into error_log.txt- add select all and unselect all button that affects column selection only (not affecting wrap text)
